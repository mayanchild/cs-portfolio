    <div >I am in 10th grade</div>
            <br>I go to summit prep
            <br>I like pizza because one of my favorite memories when I was little was when me, my brother, and my dad ordered pizza and ate it together
            <br>I also like youtube because some of the videos are fun to watch and it is sort of like a loot box, you might find something really good, but ou might also find something really bad
            <br>I dont really have any hobbies because I never really found anything of interest that I really stick with
