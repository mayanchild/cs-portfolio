    I am in 10th grade <br>
    I go to summit prep <br>
    I like pizza because one of my favorite memories when I was little was when me, my brother, and my dad ordered pizza and ate it together <br>
    I also like youtube because some of the videos are fun to watch and it is sort of like a loot box, you might find something really good, but ou might also find something really bad <br>
    I dont really have any hobies because I never really found anything of interest that I really stick with<br>

    Tags are hidden key words for you browser to know how to format things<br>
    You write tags by using <....> and bye replacing the .... with key words <br>

    and < /style >is used to style things
